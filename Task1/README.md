# **Task 1 : Login Authentication**

🔒  **Lockout Time Authentication** : We've implemented a security feature to protect user accounts. This is represented by the padlock emoji, indicating enhanced security.

👾  **Failed Login Attempts** : The system tracks failed login attempts, denoted by the alien emoji, which signifies that unauthorized access is being monitored.

⏳  **Lockout Mechanism** : When the threshold of failed attempts (e.g., 5) is reached, the system initiates a lockout. This is symbolized by the hourglass emoji, indicating a time-based lockout.

🔥  **Preventing Repeated Attempts** : During the lockout period, the system prevents repeated login attempts, shown by the fire emoji, signifying that unauthorized access is temporarily blocked.

🔄  **Automatic Reset** : After a designated time period (e.g., 24 hours), the system automatically resets the login attempts and lockout time, depicted by the clockwise arrows emoji, allowing the user to try again.

🛡️  **Enhanced Security** : This mechanism not only protects against brute-force attacks but also enhances account security. The shield emoji represents the strengthened security.

📊  **Database Integration** : We utilize a database (📊) to store user data securely. This includes information about login attempts, lockout times, and user account details.

📣  **User-Friendly Feedback** : Clear feedback is provided to users, ensuring they are informed about the lockout period or successful logins. The loudspeaker emoji signifies communication with users.

💼  **Database Integrity** : The integrity of user data and account information is maintained, signified by the briefcase emoji, representing organization and data management.

🔧  **Database Configuration** : We carefully monitor and maintain the database's configuration (🔧) to ensure the correct functioning of the lockout time authentication.
